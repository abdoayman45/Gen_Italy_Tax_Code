# Italian Tax Code Generator Project

## Project Description
This project provides two main features:

1. **Generate Random Italian Citizen Data**:
   - Allows you to generate random data for an Italian citizen, including a tax code.

2. **Calculate Tax Code for Specific Data**:
   - If you have specific personal information about an individual, the program calculates their Italian tax code.
   - If the person does not already have an official Italian tax code, the program simulates what their tax code would be if they applied for one in Italy.
